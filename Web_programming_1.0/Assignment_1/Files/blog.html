					<h4> <em>My travel to Växjö</em> </h4>
						<p>
							I come from France, a city called Nantes, so i left Nantes Tuesday 23 august at 9.00 am to Paris by carpooling, it's during five hours. Once arrive in Paris I had to go to the airport to take my fly to Copenhagen at 10.00 pm. It was midnight when i arrived in Copenhagen so I decided to take a train ticket to Växjö but i didn't know the train don't go to Växjö the night. So I must stop at Malmö and "sleep" in the train station. The stuggle was real. I took the first train to Växjö leave at 5.00 am. Here I am, finally in Växjö.

					<h4> <em>First day in Växjö</em> </h4>
					<p> When I arrived in Växjö, it was sunny. I met a friend from Bangladesh and we took the bus together to university. My first impression for Växjö was really good, big lacks, a lot of green spaces and look likes a peaceful city. The only problem is that I still don't have an accommodation, so it's really hard for study. Anyway I hope i'm gonna spend a good year here.

					<h4> <em>What is robots.txt ? </em> </h4>
					<p> 
						A robots.txt file is a file at the root of your site that indicates those parts of your site you don’t want accessed by search engine crawlers. The file uses the Robots Exclusion Standard, which is a protocol with a small set of commands that can be used to indicate access to your site by section and by specific kinds of web crawlers (such as mobile crawlers vs desktop crawlers).
						The two main directives of the standard are: <br />

						    - User-agent : Defines the search engine that a rule applies to. <br />
						    - Disallow : Advises a search engine not to crawl and index a file, page, or directory
					</p>

					<h4><em> How have you configure it for your site ? </em> </h4>
					<p>
							User-agent: * <br />
							Disallow: https://1dv525.github.io/cf222jb-examination-1/Files/contact.html <br />

							An asterisk (*) can be used as a wildcard with User-agent to refer to all search engines. <br />
							Advises a search engine not to crawl and index a file, page, or directory. Here for example, I used disallow to not craws and index the contact.html file.

					<h4><em>What is human.txt ? </em></h4>
					<p>  
						It's an initiative for knowing the people behind a website. It's a TXT file that contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.
						By adding a txt file, you can prove your authorship (not your property) in an external, fast, easy and accessible way.
						The internet is for humans. The only aim of this initiative is to know who the authors of the sites we visit are.
					</p>
					<h4><em> How have you configure it for your site ? </em> </h4>
					<p>
							/* TEAM */ <br />
							It's information about me, where I founded the website. <br />
							/* SITE */ <br />
							Information about the website, last update, how realised. <br />

					 <h4><em>What is Open Graph ? </em> </h4>
					 <p>
						The Open Graph protocol enables any web page to become a rich object in a social graph. For instance, this is used on Facebook to allow any web page to have the same functionality as any other object on Facebook (or twitter). <br />

						While many different technologies and schemas exist and could be combined together, there isn't a single technology which provides enough information to richly represent any web page within the social graph. The Open Graph protocol builds on these existing technologies and gives developers one thing to implement. Developer simplicity is a key goal of the Open Graph protocol which has informed many of the technical design decisions.
						
					</p>
						<h4><em> How do you make use of it ? </em> </h4>
					<p>
						Using the protocol provide you accurate information that search engines need. This can raise the rank of your pages. This can relocate your website to higher positions in search engines like Google, because Google detects Open Graph meta tags.
						Finally, the social media are taking so much importance on the web, so it's really important to be available on the social media. That's why Open Graph is so important.

					<h4><em>Why is it important to separate the layout and design (css) from content (html)? </em> </h4>
					<p>
						Here are the most compelling reasons for using CSS and HTML over outdated methods: 
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong> Efficient of code </strong> : The larger your files are, the longer they will take to download. </li>
							<li><strong>Ease of maintenance</strong> : Following on from the last point, if your styling and layout information is only specified in one place, it means you only have to make updates in one place if you want to change your site’s appearance. </li>
							<li><strong>Device compatibility</strong> : Because my HTML page is just plain markup, with no style information, it can be reformatted for different devices with vastly differing attributes (eg screen size) by simply applying an alternative style sheet — you can do this in a few different ways </li>
							<li><strong>Web crawlers/search engines</strong> : Chances are you will want your pages to be easy to find by searching on Google, or other search engines. </li>
							<li><strong> My point of view </strong> : If you talk to any professional standards-aware web developer or designer, and they’ll tell you that separating content, style, and behaviour is the best way to develop a web application.
						</ul>
