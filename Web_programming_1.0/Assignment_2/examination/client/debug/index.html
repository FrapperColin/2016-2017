        <h3> About the assignment</h3>

        You should create an client application in which the user can answer, by the server given, quiz-questions. The user must do this in a certain time.
        If the user gives the correct answer, the application will take the user to the next question.
        If the user give the wrong answer or didn´t in time the quiz is over.
        You are responsible for the presentation of the questions, the handling of the client application logic and the user interface.
        The user shouldn't have any problem to understand the UI. Keep it simple, keep it beautiful.
        At the start of the game the user should be able to write a nickname she/he wants in the quiz game.
        The game must have a timer that gives the user a maximum of 20 seconds to answer each question.
        If the user doesn´t answer during the time or the user answer wrong it is game over and the user should be able to start the game over.
        If the user answer all of the questions with correct answers the game should record the users total time and present this in a high-score list with the five fastest times.
        The high-score will be saved in the browsers Web Storage.

        <h3>Requirements</h3>

          The client application must be written in vanilla javascript, no libraries like jQuery.
          It should be easy for the user to understand the application and how to use it.
          The application must be able to handle the different types of questions/answers that the server provide/handle.
          For every question there should be a timer counting down from 20 seconds to 0 seconds.
          The client application should also keep track of the total time the user takes to answer all the questions.
          The user should be able to choose a nickname at the start of the game that will be used in the high-score list.
          Application should use Web Storage to store a high-score list which presents the five fastest total times (on that specific client) at the end of the game.
          At least nickname and total time should be present.
